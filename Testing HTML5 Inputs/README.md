<br>

Hello and welcome! This repo is all about testing the various HTML5 input types that users can use on the front end and simply experimenting with them and learning more about them.

<br>

## What I've Learned while Studying all HTML5 Inputs:

<br>

### Markdown or .MD Files

- I learned about markdown, markdown syntax, markdown editors, markdown viewers and more.

<br>

### Range Input

- I learned about the range input.

- Range is an input attribute and can be used by typing type="range".
